    "\n",
    "Hey everyone! Welcome to the *All About Algorithms* club, where we'll explore algorithms in computer science. Algorithms have a lot to do with math, which is why they're one of my favorite aspects of computer science; plus, they're just cool in general! If you have any questions, you can email me at <span style=\"color:blue\">lanbae23@bergen.org</span>, or Discord friend/message me (<span style=\"color:blue\">Lance#1721</span>). Plus, Autumn (<span style=\"color:blue\">autshi22@bergen.org</span>) and Jaiden (<span style=\"color:blue\">jaishi23@bergen.org</span>) agreed to help me out; they're just as good (if not better) than me with competitive programming, so feel free to contact them too!"

    "\n",
    "I'll be uploading all of the material for this club on my Github repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/LanceB57/All-About-Algorithms). Github is a super useful resource for coding projects, and I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with it if you haven't already. I'm also pretty sure Mr. Wang reviews it in Intro to Comp Sci, so this'll give you freshmen a head start!\n",

    "\n",
    "All of the problem sets and solutions will most likely be written in Jupyter Notebooks (also a super helpful resouce!). For introductory problem sets, we'll write solutions in both Python and C++. As for intermediate, we'll write solutions in only C++, as Python will not be fast enough for harder problems. Hence, I highly recommend learning C++ if you haven't already; it'll definitely come in handy down the road. Resources for learning Python and C++ can be found in Introductory Problem Set 1! As for Java, although it is usually fast enough for harder problems, we still recommend that you use C++ (pointers are cool!). \n",
    "\n",
    "All problem set solutions will be password protected so that only club members can access them. Official solutions can be confusing at times, so we thought it would be best to write our own. If you need a password for a solution, let us know.\n",

    "Most, if not all, problems will come from [USACO](http://usaco.org/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), or [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), so make sure to create your accounts for these before our first meeting.\n",

    "\n",
    "For regular meetings, we'll have three breakout rooms: Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced. We know that it might be awkward talking to people you don't know/haven't met in person, but we really encourage that you all collaborate verbally on problems! If you're able to create these relationships now, they'll prove to be valuable as you progress throughout your programming career.\n",

Intermediate problem sets will be focused on those who are pushing to pass Bronze or looking to familiarize themselves with Silver strategies. The Advanced sessions will be for everyone else and we'll instead do something like a \"Problem of the Day\".\n",

    "I will be giving a few optional lecture series throughout the duration of this club. I expect students in the Intermediate/Advanced problem sessions to attend these lectures, but it is ultimately up to you. During weeks when there are lectures, we will have only one breakout room going on and help will most likely be unavailable during club time. This would be a good opportunity to use the Discord server if you need help!\n",

    "Because of our current situation with clubs being optional, I will try to host lectures (and only lectures; no problem session) every Wednesday after school (probably from two to three). Of course, attendance at these meetings will not be required. If you're not looking to attend lectures but still want to work on algorithms, you can work on the problem sets on your own time. If you ever need a more detailed explanation or are still confused by our solutions, ask on the Discord!"

They'll be rigorous, involve different aspects of math, and certainly improve your understanding of algorithms in computer science (which is fun)! However, I want to make sure that everyone attending lectures will be able to understand each and every part of them. Because of this, I recommend caution if you're going to attend; if you're unsure on if lectures are right for you, feel free to sit in on a couple and evaluate from that.\n",
