    "#### Lance B.\n",
    "This question requires a tiny bit of math, but it is definitely manageable. They key to this solution is that an even number (boy number one's part) plus an even number (boy number two's part) must equal another even number. This way, we can simply output \"YES\" if the input is a positive even number greater than $2$ ($2$ cannot be created via two positive even numbers), and \"NO\" otherwise. We check if a number is divisible by $2$ using the modulo operator. Here are the solution codes:\n",

    "However, there's also another, more challenging, solution without converting the paramter into a string. This would be to continuously get the digit in $x$'s ones place, add it to another variable, say $y$, multiply $y$ by $10$, then divide $x$ by $10$. This way, we can compare $y$ to our original parameter, and we should get the same answer. This is essentially \"reversing\" the number using math. Make sure to have another variable to keep track of what your original paramter was.\n",

    "#### Lance B.\n",
    "For this question, let's consider four cases. If the $m$ and $n$ are both even, we can pack as many dominos as we want without any going out-of-bounds. If the $m$ is even and $n$ is odd, we can still pack as many as we want without any going out-of-bounds. An odd $m$ and even $n$ uses the same logic. As of right now, our formula is simply $\\frac{m \\cdot n}{2}$. However, if both $m$ and $n$ are odd, we cannot include that half domino that would be sticking out; we'd have to subtract $\\frac{1}{2}$ from our current formula. Luckily, we can simply take the floor of $\\frac{m \\cdot n}{2}$, and we won't have to do anything extra for the odd $m$ by odd $n$ case. Therefore, our final formula is $[{\\frac{m \\cdot n}{2}}]$, where $[x]$ is the greatest integer $\\le x$.\n",

    "Believe or not, this question is quite simple! All we have to do is keep track of the biggest and smallest $x$ and $y$ values. The biggest $x$ and $y$ values would form the top right corner of our rectangle, and the smallest $x$ and $y$ values would form the bottom left corner of our rectangle. We can then use the differences between the $x$ and $y$ values to calculate the length and width of the rectangle.
