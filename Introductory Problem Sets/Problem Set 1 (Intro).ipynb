    "This problem set will be for students who are new to programming and trying to familiarize themselves with Bronze-level problems on USACO. Problems will increase in difficult, ending with a USACO problem. Problem sets will overall get more difficult to ensure growth. If you finish a problem set, ask us for our written solutions (official ones can be quite confusing at times, so we wrote our own) and move onto the next! Don't feel pressured to finish one problem set per meeting; go at your own pace. As always, feel free to reach out for help with any problems."

As for learning how to develop a \"programming mindset\", [this](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcpp/index.html) is a great C++ textbook.
