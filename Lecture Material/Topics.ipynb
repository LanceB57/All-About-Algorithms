Graph Algorithms are used in a variety of different areas of computer science, especially Artificial Intelligence. Will probably require two meetings, and I recommend we do Graph Theory beforehand."

RSA Encryption is a very common encryption technique, and it's used in web browsers, chatting applications, VPNs, and many other types of communication. After discussing how RSA Encryption works (and trying it out for ourselves), we'll discuss how Quantum Computing can essentially \"break\" it. Will probably require only one meeting, and is a great setup for P vs. NP."

Deep Learning is a subtopic of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and it deals specifically with the use of artifical neural networks. We'll spend a lot of time dwelling over the mathematics behind Deep Learning and eventually code and test a neural network of our own! Will probably take about $5$ meetings, and prep will take some time."
